The Project
================================================================================

The project developed in Java aims to compare the performance of encryption and hashing algorithms

It is a GUI program with a simple and easy-to-use interface.
Encryption and hashing algorithms
You can clone, run, and compile the code.

You can also run the program located at dist/GUIFormExamples.jar and dist/Hasher.jar
